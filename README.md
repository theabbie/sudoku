## How to play

> Sudoku is played on a grid of 9 x 9 spaces. Within the rows and columns are 9 “squares” (made up of 3 x 3 spaces). Each row, column and square (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers 1-9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square.

* Click on a tile to increment it's number by 1
    * `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 1`
* If some tiles have invalid value (repeated in row / column / `3X3` region) it will be marked in red.
* Click on `solve` button on bottom to solve the sudoku with current state, if it's solvable, the sudoku will be filled with values.
